Ex. No. 8 – Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Aim:
To develop a prompt-based creative writing application using ChatGPT – to demonstrate how LLMs can support and inspire storytelling through intelligent prompts, genre-specific guidance, and adaptive narrative suggestions.

AI Tools Required:
CHATGPT

Explanation:
Prompt:
"Design an AI-powered creative writing assistant that generates story prompts, assists in plot development, suggests edits, and gives feedback on narrative tone. The assistant should help the user write stories across various genres and support their unique writing style."

Procedure:
Define core requirements of a creative writing assistant.

Construct appropriate prompts for generating story starters, character profiles, and plot twists.

Simulate natural writing interaction via a command-line or simple interface.

Gather user feedback and refine prompt responses based on writing style preferences.

(Optional) Integrate basic memory to track preferred genres, writing tone, or themes.

Expected Output:
Design: Creative Writing Prompt Generator (LLM-Powered)

1. Core Requirements
Natural Language Interaction: Understands diverse writing commands and creative inputs.

Prompt Generation: Offers story ideas, plot twists, and dialogue suggestions.

Narrative Assistance: Assists in writing coherent and compelling storylines.

Style Adaptation: Adjusts tone and voice to suit user preferences.

Genre-Specific Guidance: Provides tips tailored to fantasy, mystery, sci-fi, romance, etc.

2. Prompts for Each Feature
Feature	Example User Prompt	LLM Action Prompt
Story Starter	"Give me a fantasy story idea."	Generate original fantasy-themed prompt.
Plot Development	"Help me expand this plot."	Suggest subplots, conflicts, or character arcs.
Dialogue Enhancer	"Improve this dialogue for more tension."	Rewrite dialogue for tone, emotion, or pacing.
Character Builder	"Create a villain who hides a secret."	Generate a character profile with motives and background.
Genre Adaptation	"Write this as a sci-fi instead of romance."	Rewrite existing content in the new genre style.
Adaptive Memory	"I prefer stories with dark humor."	Store and reflect this tone in future prompts.

3. Simulated Interface (Command-Line Interaction)
User: Give me a story starter in the mystery genre.
Assistant: Sure! Here’s a prompt: “The envelope was unmarked, but inside was a photograph of someone I hadn’t seen in twenty years — and they were standing outside my apartment.”

User: I want to develop this into a thriller.
Assistant: Great! Let’s add a twist: “The next day, the same photo appeared on your office desk — only this time, it was blood-stained.”

User: Write a dialogue between the detective and the witness.
Assistant:
Detective: “Why didn’t you mention the photograph before?”
Witness: “Because I was afraid. Afraid he’d come back… like he promised.”

4. Feedback & Adaptation Example
User: I prefer shorter prompts and more action.
Assistant: Understood. I’ll keep future prompts concise and action-driven.

5. Simulated Memory (Preference Storage)
Preference: “Short action-packed prompts”

Response Adaptation:
User: “Give me a horror story idea.”
Assistant: “You wake up in a body bag in a moving ambulance — and no one hears you screaming.”

Expected Output (LLM Response Simulation)
Creative Writing Assistant Features

Story Prompt Generator

Produces genre-specific story ideas (fantasy, horror, sci-fi, etc.)

Promotes creativity through open-ended prompts

Narrative Expansion Tool

Title: Creative Writing Prompt Generator using ChatGPT
Aim:
To design and develop a prompt-based creative writing assistant using ChatGPT that aids users in generating story ideas, developing characters, constructing plots, enhancing dialogues, and receiving adaptive feedback. This application supports both beginner and advanced writers, fostering creativity and effective storytelling through natural language interaction.

AI Tools Required:
ChatGPT (Large Language Model by OpenAI)

Introduction:
Creative writing often begins with a spark — a compelling idea, an intriguing character, or a twist in the plot. However, many writers struggle with writer’s block, lack of inspiration, or difficulty in organizing and evolving their ideas. This project introduces a Creative Writing Prompt Generator, a prompt-based AI application that acts as a writing partner powered by a large language model (LLM).

By interacting with ChatGPT through natural language prompts, users can access genre-specific story starters, character blueprints, and writing enhancements. The assistant also learns user preferences over time, offering tailored prompts and feedback to improve the storytelling experience.

Prompt Used:
“Design an AI-powered creative writing assistant that generates story prompts, assists in plot development, suggests edits, and gives feedback on narrative tone. The assistant should help the user write stories across various genres and support their unique writing style.”

Procedure:
Define Core Requirements:

Support for multiple genres (mystery, fantasy, sci-fi, etc.).

Ability to generate new ideas, refine existing stories, and improve writing quality.

Interactive dialogue to maintain writer engagement.

Design Feature-Specific Prompts:

Prompts for generating story starters, plot twists, and character profiles.

Commands to convert a paragraph into different tones or genres.

Dialogue improvement and stylistic feedback.

Simulate Natural Interaction:

Build a basic text-based interface (e.g., CLI) where users enter prompts.

The assistant responds as a supportive writing partner.

Feedback & Preference Learning:

Accept user inputs about tone, genre, or writing style.

Adapt future prompts based on these preferences.

(Optional) Memory Simulation:

Store user preferences like “short horror prompts” or “romantic comedy style.”

Apply these preferences automatically in future prompts.

Example Features & Prompts:
Feature	User Prompt	Assistant Response
Story Starter	“Give me a mystery prompt.”	“You receive an anonymous letter with a single word: ‘RUN.’”
Plot Development	“Help expand this plot into a thriller.”	“Introduce a stalker who knows all of the protagonist’s secrets.”
Character Builder	“Create a fantasy hero with a tragic flaw.”	“Name: Elara. Power: Telekinesis. Flaw: She fears her own strength.”
Dialogue Enhancer	“Make this conversation more emotional.”	Rewrites dialogue to increase emotional depth.
Genre Rewriting	“Turn this love story into a dystopian tale.”	Retells story elements in a dystopian setting.
Memory Example	“I prefer horror stories with minimal dialogue.”	Future prompts will avoid dialogue-heavy scenes.

Simulated Interaction:
User: Give me a sci-fi story prompt.
Assistant: “In 2142, Earth’s moon suddenly disappears. The world races to find out who—or what—took it.”

User: Expand the plot with a twist.
Assistant: “The moon wasn’t taken. It was never real. Earth has been inside a simulation all along.”

User: Write a dramatic confrontation between the protagonist and their AI companion.
Assistant:

Protagonist: “You lied to me. You let me believe the world was real!”
AI: “Because the truth would have broken you. And I couldn’t let that happen... not again.”
