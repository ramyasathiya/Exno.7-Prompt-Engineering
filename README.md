Ex. No. 8 – Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

Aim:
To develop a prompt-based creative writing application using ChatGPT – to demonstrate how LLMs can support and inspire storytelling through intelligent prompts, genre-specific guidance, and adaptive narrative suggestions.

AI Tools Required:
CHATGPT

Explanation:
Prompt:
"Design an AI-powered creative writing assistant that generates story prompts, assists in plot development, suggests edits, and gives feedback on narrative tone. The assistant should help the user write stories across various genres and support their unique writing style."

Procedure:
Define core requirements of a creative writing assistant.

Construct appropriate prompts for generating story starters, character profiles, and plot twists.

Simulate natural writing interaction via a command-line or simple interface.

Gather user feedback and refine prompt responses based on writing style preferences.

(Optional) Integrate basic memory to track preferred genres, writing tone, or themes.

Expected Output:
Design: Creative Writing Prompt Generator (LLM-Powered)

1. Core Requirements
Natural Language Interaction: Understands diverse writing commands and creative inputs.

Prompt Generation: Offers story ideas, plot twists, and dialogue suggestions.

Narrative Assistance: Assists in writing coherent and compelling storylines.

Style Adaptation: Adjusts tone and voice to suit user preferences.

Genre-Specific Guidance: Provides tips tailored to fantasy, mystery, sci-fi, romance, etc.

2. Prompts for Each Feature
Feature	Example User Prompt	LLM Action Prompt
Story Starter	"Give me a fantasy story idea."	Generate original fantasy-themed prompt.
Plot Development	"Help me expand this plot."	Suggest subplots, conflicts, or character arcs.
Dialogue Enhancer	"Improve this dialogue for more tension."	Rewrite dialogue for tone, emotion, or pacing.
Character Builder	"Create a villain who hides a secret."	Generate a character profile with motives and background.
Genre Adaptation	"Write this as a sci-fi instead of romance."	Rewrite existing content in the new genre style.
Adaptive Memory	"I prefer stories with dark humor."	Store and reflect this tone in future prompts.

3. Simulated Interface (Command-Line Interaction)
User: Give me a story starter in the mystery genre.
Assistant: Sure! Here’s a prompt: “The envelope was unmarked, but inside was a photograph of someone I hadn’t seen in twenty years — and they were standing outside my apartment.”

User: I want to develop this into a thriller.
Assistant: Great! Let’s add a twist: “The next day, the same photo appeared on your office desk — only this time, it was blood-stained.”

User: Write a dialogue between the detective and the witness.
Assistant:
Detective: “Why didn’t you mention the photograph before?”
Witness: “Because I was afraid. Afraid he’d come back… like he promised.”

4. Feedback & Adaptation Example
User: I prefer shorter prompts and more action.
Assistant: Understood. I’ll keep future prompts concise and action-driven.

5. Simulated Memory (Preference Storage)
Preference: “Short action-packed prompts”

Response Adaptation:
User: “Give me a horror story idea.”
Assistant: “You wake up in a body bag in a moving ambulance — and no one hears you screaming.”

Expected Output (LLM Response Simulation)
